  <body>
    <h2>Q.1. List out the features of HTML5.</h2>
    <ol>
      <p> <strong style="font-size: larger;">Solution:</strong>
        HTML5, the fifth and latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language,
        introduced numerous new features and improvements for web development.
        Here are some of the key features of HTML5
      </p>
      <li><strong>Semantics:</strong> HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like "header", "nav", "section", "article", "footer", and "aside", which provide a clearer structure to web documents, making it easier for both developers and assistive technologies to understand the content's purpose.</li>
      <li><strong>Multimedia Support: </strong>HTML5 includes native support for audio and video playback via the "audio" and "video" elements, reducing the need for third-party plugins like Flash.</li>
      <li><strong>Canvas:</strong> The "canvas" element allows developers to create dynamic graphics, animations, and games directly within the browser using JavaScript.</li>
      <li><strong>Geolocation: </strong>HTML5 provides a Geolocation API that enables websites to access the user's geographical location, allowing for location-aware applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs allow web applications to store data locally on the user's device, reducing the need for server-side storage.</li>
      <li><strong>Web Storage:</strong> HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs for storing key-value pairs in a more structured way than cookies.</li>
      <li><strong>Web Workers:</strong> Web Workers enable multithreading in web applications, allowing CPU-intensive tasks to run in the background without freezing the user interface.</li>
      <li><strong>Web Sockets:</strong> HTML5 introduced Web Sockets, a communication protocol that enables bidirectional, real-time communication between the client and server, facilitating the development of interactive web applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Drag and Drop: </strong>HTML5 offers native support for drag-and-drop interactions, making it easier to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> HTML5 includes features to improve web accessibility, including the "alt" attribute for images and the use of semantic elements to provide better structure for screen readers.</li>
      <li><strong>Responsive Web Design: </strong>HTML5 works well with CSS3 and media queries to create responsive web designs that adapt to various screen sizes and devices.</li>
      <li><strong>Offline Application Cache:</strong> The Application Cache, also known as AppCache, allows web applications to work offline by caching resources locally.</li>
      <li><strong>History API:</strong> The History API allows developers to manipulate the browser's history and URL without causing page reloads, enabling the creation of single-page applications (SPAs) and improving user experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Improved Security: </strong>HTML5 includes features like the sandbox attribute for iframes, the Content Security Policy (CSP) for mitigating cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and more robust security measures.</li>
      <li><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> Various features of HTML5, such as native multimedia support and the use of asynchronous loading for scripts and stylesheets, contribute to improved website performance</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        These are some of the key features of HTML5 that have made it a significant advancement in web development, enabling developers to create more interactive, efficient, and accessible web applications.
